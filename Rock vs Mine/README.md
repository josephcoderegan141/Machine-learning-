Here I created a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine from sonar data. The data is split into training and test sets, 
and the model is trained on the training set. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and test sets.
Finally, I have created a prediction system that takes sonar data for one instance and predicts whether the object is a rock or a mine based on the trained model.
